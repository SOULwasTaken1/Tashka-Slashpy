# Pycord starter template
[Pycord](https://pycord.dev) is a modern, easy to use, feature-rich, and async ready API wrapper for Discord. 
This template is setup with cogs amd examples for a basic bot

# Usage / Steps to a running the bot
- Add your bot token to `BOT_TOKEN` in secrets
- Add your Discord user id to `OWNER_ID` in secrets
- Add your development server id to `guild_ids` list (in cogs) for instant slash command registering. Remove them if you wish for it to be a global command (it takes a few hours for them to register)
